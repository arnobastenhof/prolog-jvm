/**
 * Utility class for Prolog machine words, based on the exposition of their
 * realization in the Warren Abstract Machine (WAM) found in [1]. The WAM's
 * take on words differs in several respects from that found in the literature
 * on the ZIP (see [2]), but both adopt the basic premise of their
 * decomposition into a tag and a value, making the two notions largely
 * interchangeable. Besides some differences in the naming conventions for
 * tags, the deviations from [2] are outlined in the list below. In summary,
 * the WAM's specification for words is mostly a simpler one, motivating our
 * preference towards it.
 * <ul>
 * <li> As with [2], words are defined as consisting of 32-bit quantities.
 * However, we have used an 8 bit tag (comprising the word's most significant
 * byte) and a 24 bit value, as opposed to a 4 bit tag and 26 bit value. Note
 * that in this we differ from the WAM as well.
 * <li> Only a subset of the tags proposed in [1] are here used. Mostly this is
 * due to our restriction to only a very modest subset of (pure) Prolog,
 * although we have also neglected to introduce separate tags for words
 * representing bound and unbound variables. Instead, as with the WAM, we use
 * only a single tag, representing unbound variables by self references.
 * <ul>
