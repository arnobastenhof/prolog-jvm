Prolog-JVM
==========

Introduction
------------
Prolog-JVM is a simple Prolog interpreter written in Java. It combines a
bytecode compiler and a virtual machine grounded in the stack-based ZIP
architecture described by Bowen, Byrd and Clocksin in "A portable Prolog
compiler" (1983), and by Clocksin in "Design and simulation of a sequential
Prolog machine" (1985). I wrote Prolog-JVM mainly for self-educational purposes.

Requirements
------------
* Java SE7
* Gradle 2.x
